His brain warped around this loophole, this unrealistic reality, confusing the shit out of him.  He just wanted to freeze the world and concentrate on the blinding events swirling around him in the past days.  Oh wait, I can freeze time, he remembers.  He squints his already squinted eyes and a blinding light burns his lens... Then the world froze, the leaves hanging in the air as if hung by a wire, the thunder flash in the distance was frozen like a play backdrop.  He breathes heavily and starts bawling into the palm of his fragile hands.  Cheated by a girl, seeing a dead guy, kidnapped by wolf/Russians/I don't even know/ and then discovering his weird disgusting powers, was all to much to take in.  He just needed time to sort this mess out, and he had time.  What felt like hours of crying and trudging along the forest paths, he looked up and squinted.  The world awoke from its slumber and resumed its task.  After a few more minutes, he bounced all the way to a small lake.  Staring down at his reflection, he could barely recognize himself anymore: the transformation of chicken had left his skin ghastly sagging.  He realized he was boy at day, but chicken at night.  Once he activated his first powers, the button of transformation fused in with his DNA, folding up proteins to fit his new structure.  As a boy he figured, his powers could still be used by hindered by his human form.  His jumps were a little shorter, his echolocation was a tad more blurry, he could time freeze for about 400 Mississippi's instead of indefinite as a chicken. Too tired to do anything he laid by the lakeside and closed his eyes.  As night neared, he awoke and gazed at his reflection.  A daunting beak, a blood red crest, blue eyes with a crest shaped dipoles revealed itself to the young chicken.  He squinted once again.  Days went by in the frozen world as it seemed, as he jumped around until he reached the city.  The city was light up, bright and bold, and as he neared the city, the sign "WELCOME TO FABULOUS LAS VEGAS" loomed above him.  Las Vegas?  What the hell?  He was literally just in Mountain View before the kidnapping.  Well, there is a long trip home he thought, but of course time was on his side.  Bouncing all the way back to Mountain View, he discovered new found powers: The Chickonic Boom.  If he concentrated his thoughts on becoming a streak of meteorite he could blast a few miles with super sonic speed and fall straight to the ground creating a crater.  He was streaking his way through the frozen world creating miles and miles filled with house sized craters.  As of this point he does not even care.  All he wanted to do is go home and eat some ramen and make his life normal once again.  As he neared his street he bounced up to the school to find an empty lot except for one car.  Curiosity got the best of him and he walked to the car.  He peaked inside to find Geal atop that stupid jerk working her mouth closely into his.  Disgusted he decided to do something out of revenge.  He tries to push and pull but to no avail, the car was better than his.  Frustrated once again he just claps his hand in front of the car and a blast of wind pushes the car out of the lot into the street.  Woah, Cyclone Flap, he thought.  Well that good enough revenge for now.  No that was not enough.  The pain she caused him was not repaid.  He decides to scare and haunt her.  Jumping straight to the car, he hunches atop the hood staring hard into the windshield, ready to resume time and scare the shit out of the intimate jerks.  He squints and smiles a humorous smile.  Time resumes, the intimate couple continue with their interactions until the jerk stops and stares at what seems to be a giant squatting chicken man.  Geal turn immediately around and screams.  The frightening shock on her face was enough to satisfy his ambitions. He squints leaving her in a frozen shock, and jumps back to his house.  He was about to open the front door, until he remembered he was still in chicken form.  His parents would disband him permanently an deliver him to the police which will deliver him to government authorities who will run all sorts of tests like in those movies he used to watch.  He decides to go and sleep up on the roof.  He hops to his window grabbing a blanket and a pencil.  He scribbles down every power he knows he has now, on his paper in his pocket.  
Chicken leap(super jump)
Reverse slaughterhouse(Time freeze)
KuKu Scream(Crowinglocation)
Chickonic Boom( Super flight)
Cyclone Flap(Air bender hadouken)
​
Finishing his notes, he spreads the blanket out and lays upon it.  Squinting his eyes before shutting them, the peaceful night breeze brushes across his feathers.  This was probably the best sleep he has gotten in days and probably the last.
