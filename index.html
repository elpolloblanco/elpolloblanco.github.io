Our story starts with a very old artifact, found deep within Tony's old documents.  We did a little research and discovered this young child went with the alias of Russell Chien.  He was a very white child from birth to his end.  His story truly touched us, and revealed to us his deep emotions hiding under that ivory skin of his. Now it’s our turn, to shed some light on his dark secret. This is all how the story begins...

A white chick...
A young white chick entering the world full of curiosity only to grow up and feed the slaughterhouse.
His inquiring looks shows so much interest for the world but now he has a heart of ice swearing his soul out and spending his days drowning is melancholy classical music.  
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p class="story-text">
As he calls others gay, he looks into the mirror.  Questioning himself. How did I get into this deep black abyss of hopelessness? Why am I stuck here? With fake friends. With a fake personality. With a... a... a fake life. He looks at himself in the mirror again, trying to seek a happiness inside himself. But, all that stares back, is a white empty soulless figure setting his gaze on him with disdain.
He looks for comfort within his phone. His pokemon go. He tells himself that at least he has one goal left in this life... To catch them all.

As the days go on this poor child named white chicken loses all meaning for life

And so the white chicken our hero of the story slowly treads towards the slaughterhouse
But something holds him back... something someone told him... who is this someone? His curiosity returns...
Memories flood his mind but his suicidal goal still pounds in the back of his head.
Will El Pollo Blanco reach for new hope or give in to the throbbing pain in his life?

What is this thing you ask. What is this thing that's keeping him from the gates of hell. His friends? His instagram? His fear of the fiery depths that will singe his tender white chicken skin? No. It has to be something greater. Something that is sustaining this feeble life of his and pulling him from his absolute goal. His goal to get out of this vile world. Something that gives some meaning to his life....... Today was an eclipse. A special day. A day worth living. He might as well spend one worthwhile day on this Earth before going... A feather is blown by the gentle breeze onto his lap. He looks down at it... "THE PAIN!!! MY EYES!!! WHAT THE F*#&!!! IT HURTS!!!" The light of the eclipse burns his eyes as it reflects off his pale white skin. He couldn't see for a while, then his vision came back. Is this what pain was like? How could the light get into my eyes even though I'm Asian and my eyes are slits? Then he spots something out of the corner of his eye. Something gorgeous. Something beautiful. Something more intriguing than pokemon go. What can this be?
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p class="story-text">
How very intriguing.  The world seemed so much brighter, was it that burning singe of sunlight that moments ago just stung his eyes?  That question he does not know.  What he does know is what he sees.  A beautiful glimpse of a young lady.  Her auburn hair and her ivory skin, her emerald green eyes, and her pretty white skirt.  He is so entrapped by her beauty, stuck in the middle of hell and love, his raging heart slows down.  He found inner peace at last or so he thought.  Days go by as he tries to work up the courage to talk to her.  He discovered she was of Irish descendant and her name was Geal Sicin.  His blood pounds in the head as the image of her dashing smile flashed around in his mind.  He was in love.  He thought this is the exact reason why people live, the reason to suffer in this cruel world.  He thought he was ready and safe, he thought his mind and heart would be ready, but his actions proved differently.  
 
This night was the night of prom, and all the school was attending.  He gathers up courage for a last minute effort to ask out Geal.  His efforts were worthy for she said yes.  He was so happy he smiled.  This was the first time he smiled in years.  He suited up and looked ready to take out his love for prom, but as he rounded the school corner, he could clearly see her mouth was intimately wrapped within another man’s mouth.  Tears rolled down his eyes and soon rage burned through heart.  All common sense was seared, and he stormed off into the night.  He stomped down the street blindly, only to open his eyes and see he was soaring above tree tops.  What is this monstrosity he thought.  He squinted his eyes to look closely and a bright beam of light blinded him.  He opened his eyes only to find the world has stopped.  No sound, no birds, no cars.  Had he stopped time by squinting?  He squinted once again only to find noise arousing all around him.  Super Jump, Time Freeze, what else could he possibly have? But he wondered, where did he get these powers?
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p class="story-text">
His mom, a Shanghainese travel agent. His dad, a well-trained vet. No blood containing this power was flowing inside his veins. Then how could this be? How could he have transformed from a white chick, to a… to a… to a rooster with these powers with no sign of this transformation? Was this not only from his parent, but further down his pedigree? No, it can’t. He knew his family lineage like the back of his hand. Lee kong, Song tong, yang xin, yes. It can’t be from his family, nobody was ever special. Then where, where had this sudden burst of power come from. He had come from hell and back, experienced love that was not true. Not authentic. Not genuine. Was it this feeling of being betrayed, of being taken away of everything, that caused God to give him a gift. Were these powers God’s gift. He had a fast mind, had cognitive abilities, but everywhere he looked for reason, there was none. This was a God’s gift to reimburse him for the troubles he’s had. It was the only answer.
 
This young chick has yet again been saved from the depths of hell, maybe saved forever. Now, nothing that had tormented him before could hurt him again. Not Geal. Not his past. Not even death. Now, he was searching again. Searching for another answer. What could make him feel pain? His result: Nothing. Nothing could touch him ever again. A certain feeling of power rose within. This new confidence was something that he hasn’t felt in the entirety of his life. It was like an enlightenment that drove all the worries out of his mind.
 
He then all of a sudden came back to reality. He was sitting on a bench, on the side of the road. A singular lamp lighting the way. It was raining. He hadn’t noticed this, since he was deep in thought. Had he really experienced that. Did he actually have powers that the people only dreamed of. Then, all of a sudden he remembered what had snapped him back from his pondering. A noise. A faint, eerie sound coming from an ominous alleyway 2 blocks away. Did he still have those powers? Does he still have this confidence to investigate?

Slowly, but hesitantly he looks down at his hands.  Afraid of what he might see, he peeks down.  A wave of relief washes over him as he stared down at his glowing white hands.  He raised one hand and points it down the street.  As soon as he thought of shooting something down the street into the alley, a loud screech of a rooster crowed all the way down into the alleyway.  Crows fluttered up by the dozens.  He was astonished to see his newly found power of Crowinglocation.  He could mentally picture his surrounding with that one screech.  He saw something like a thermal detector, all the shapes and heat waves.  This would be so useful he thought.  Before he ventured down to the alley, he took out a paper and scrawled down his new names for his new powers:
Chicken leap(super jump)
Reverse slaughterhouse(Time freeze)
KuKu Scream(Crowinglocation)
ETc.?
 
He crumpled up the paper and shoved it down his formal pants.  He trudged down to the alleyway in a heavy downpour, only to find a body.  It was half disassembled, blood mixed with rainwater gurgling down to the sewers.  This person’s fingers were gone and so was his lower half of the body.  It looked like a he to Russell, but he wasn’t sure.  In his chest, a whole had been ripped out, the exact spot where the heart should be.  He remembered in his Kuku Scream, seeing three men towering over the man.  Russell thought it was some mugging business, or a drug deal gone bad, but he never imagined it to become this violent.  He slowly knelt over the body and saw a silver necklace in a shape of a bird, no a turkey to be specific.  He wrapped his hands around it, and yanked.  He took the necklace and placed it in his pocket.  He furthered his examination to find a note tucked in the shirt pocket.  It read 21 right 3 left 3 right.  What could this possibly mean?  He shrugged it off and tucked it away in his pockets.  Now he was shivering cold in the dark with a dead person whose gender he assumed was of male origin.  He was grossed out to see the assumption to just leave the man to rot out here, so he picked the man up and tossed him in the dumpster.  “At least he has shelter and a meh burial place”, he thought to himself.  Soaked in water and blood, he turns around to head home, but then something hit him very hard.  Blackness consumed him.  Wait were those wolves?  No they had hands… Werewolves?  Wolf-man tribe?  
Unconsciousness swept over, and the last thought in his mind was: As a living chicken boy, I’ve been kidnapped by a tribe of Wolf-man….

A sound. It had awakened him. A feeling. It made him shiver. A smell. It frightened him.
In a cold, dark warehouse laid a wary white chicken. He had a soul whiter than white people, and a mind dirtier than dirt. Before he was just a kid, with no super ordinary speciality, just his whiteness, there for others to make fun of him of. Now, he had powers only people could dream of, and he was now also stuck in a warehouse, kidnapped by people of the unknown.
He was in a chair, strung up and blindfolded. He felt a sliver of warmth that landed upon his soft skin. He deduced it was morning, and the sun was rising. Why was he stuck in this place? Was it because he just witnessed a murder. There was a sound of a door opening, then footsteps, coming nearer and nearer. Some sense gave the location of this person. Did he have echolocation too, he would have to add that to his list. He knew the man was close by, about 3 feet away. More footsteps from the door. There were 8 men now, all surrounding him. “I can see that you are awake now.” said the man directly in front of him. He had a thick Russian accent. Then he thought, ooohhh no. He wasn't going down the road of a movie action scene. He was highly educated on this topic and knew that this was how they all started. He wasn’t ready for that. So, he stood up, with the chair, and jumped as hard as he could against the ground. He felt the sensation again. Rising in the air as fast as a bullet, he smashed through the wood ceiling and landed outside on the soft ground. He heard some shouts of Russian inside the warehouse. The chair was smashed off on impact with the ceiling, so his hands and legs were free. He then took off his blindfold. Where was he? He didn’t recognize this place at all, there was an endless view of sea in front of him. The sun was rising, the temperature was climbing fast. Men burst from the doors armed with guns. What could he do, he didn’t have any weapons of that sort, not unless… He took off his shirt to reveal his flabby dead skin. In an instant a group of men screamed in pain and clutched their eyes. This was his weapon, his white skin. It wasn’t a deterrent from god, but a gift. He had hampered the group of Russian men, but more kept coming out. Was this their headquarters? He took the chance to run for it. His skinny Asian legs didn’t do him so well, but he made it out, through the edge of the forest. Now, he was shrouded in trees, they couldn’t find him now. He stopped to catch his breath. His chest rising and falling rapidly. Then he saw what was on the cloth that was used to tie him up. It was a number. 169307. He didn’t know if it meant anything, so he reached for his shirt pocket, but then remembered that he had thrown his shirt on the ground when escaping the Russians. He took a piece of paper out of his pocket and scrawled on it the number that was on the cloth, also jotting down the potential hint from the dead man. He just then realized how exhausted and famished he was. He sat down to rest a while. He took his phone out, touching it for the first time in days. He thought of all the things that happened between then and now. He opened his phone, and amazingly enough he had service. He was going to check Google maps to see where he was, but when he opened it, only one thing popped up. 169307.

His brain warped around this loophole, this unrealistic reality, confusing the shit out of him.  He just wanted to freeze the world and concentrate on the blinding events swirling around him in the past days.  Oh wait, I can freeze time, he remembers.  He squints his already squinted eyes and a blinding light burns his lens... Then the world froze, the leaves hanging in the air as if hung by a wire, the thunder flash in the distance was frozen like a play backdrop.  He breathes heavily and starts bawling into the palm of his fragile hands.  Cheated by a girl, seeing a dead guy, kidnapped by wolf/Russians/I don't even know/ and then discovering his weird disgusting powers, was all to much to take in.  He just needed time to sort this mess out, and he had time.  What felt like hours of crying and trudging along the forest paths, he looked up and squinted.  The world awoke from its slumber and resumed its task.  After a few more minutes, he bounced all the way to a small lake.  Staring down at his reflection, he could barely recognize himself anymore: the transformation of chicken had left his skin ghastly sagging.  He realized he was boy at day, but chicken at night.  Once he activated his first powers, the button of transformation fused in with his DNA, folding up proteins to fit his new structure.  As a boy he figured, his powers could still be used by hindered by his human form.  His jumps were a little shorter, his echolocation was a tad more blurry, he could time freeze for about 400 Mississippi's instead of indefinite as a chicken. Too tired to do anything he laid by the lakeside and closed his eyes.  As night neared, he awoke and gazed at his reflection.  A daunting beak, a blood red crest, blue eyes with a crest shaped dipoles revealed itself to the young chicken.  He squinted once again.  Days went by in the frozen world as it seemed, as he jumped around until he reached the city.  The city was light up, bright and bold, and as he neared the city, the sign "WELCOME TO FABULOUS LAS VEGAS" loomed above him.  Las Vegas?  What the hell?  He was literally just in Mountain View before the kidnapping.  Well, there is a long trip home he thought, but of course time was on his side.  Bouncing all the way back to Mountain View, he discovered new found powers: The Chickonic Boom.  If he concentrated his thoughts on becoming a streak of meteorite he could blast a few miles with super sonic speed and fall straight to the ground creating a crater.  He was streaking his way through the frozen world creating miles and miles filled with house sized craters.  As of this point he does not even care.  All he wanted to do is go home and eat some ramen and make his life normal once again.  As he neared his street he bounced up to the school to find an empty lot except for one car.  Curiosity got the best of him and he walked to the car.  He peaked inside to find Geal atop that stupid jerk working her mouth closely into his.  Disgusted he decided to do something out of revenge.  He tries to push and pull but to no avail, the car was better than his.  Frustrated once again he just claps his hand in front of the car and a blast of wind pushes the car out of the lot into the street.  Woah, Cyclone Flap, he thought.  Well that good enough revenge for now.  No that was not enough.  The pain she caused him was not repaid.  He decides to scare and haunt her.  Jumping straight to the car, he hunches atop the hood staring hard into the windshield, ready to resume time and scare the shit out of the intimate jerks.  He squints and smiles a humorous smile.  Time resumes, the intimate couple continue with their interactions until the jerk stops and stares at what seems to be a giant squatting chicken man.  Geal turn immediately around and screams.  The frightening shock on her face was enough to satisfy his ambitions. He squints leaving her in a frozen shock, and jumps back to his house.  He was about to open the front door, until he remembered he was still in chicken form.  His parents would disband him permanently an deliver him to the police which will deliver him to government authorities who will run all sorts of tests like in those movies he used to watch.  He decides to go and sleep up on the roof.  He hops to his window grabbing a blanket and a pencil.  He scribbles down every power he knows he has now, on his paper in his pocket.  
Chicken leap(super jump)
Reverse slaughterhouse(Time freeze)
KuKu Scream(Crowinglocation)
Chickonic Boom( Super flight)
Cyclone Flap(Air bender hadouken)
​
Finishing his notes, he spreads the blanket out and lays upon it.  Squinting his eyes before shutting them, the peaceful night breeze brushes across his feathers.  This was probably the best sleep he has gotten in days and probably the last.
