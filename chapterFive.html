How very intriguing.  The world seemed so much brighter, was it that burning singe of sunlight that moments ago just stung his eyes?  That question he does not know.  What he does know is what he sees.  A beautiful glimpse of a young lady.  Her auburn hair and her ivory skin, her emerald green eyes, and her pretty white skirt.  He is so entrapped by her beauty, stuck in the middle of hell and love, his raging heart slows down.  He found inner peace at last or so he thought.  Days go by as he tries to work up the courage to talk to her.  He discovered she was of Irish descendant and her name was Geal Sicin.  His blood pounds in the head as the image of her dashing smile flashed around in his mind.  He was in love.  He thought this is the exact reason why people live, the reason to suffer in this cruel world.  He thought he was ready and safe, he thought his mind and heart would be ready, but his actions proved differently.  
 
This night was the night of prom, and all the school was attending.  He gathers up courage for a last minute effort to ask out Geal.  His efforts were worthy for she said yes.  He was so happy he smiled.  This was the first time he smiled in years.  He suited up and looked ready to take out his love for prom, but as he rounded the school corner, he could clearly see her mouth was intimately wrapped within another manâ€™s mouth.  Tears rolled down his eyes and soon rage burned through heart.  All common sense was seared, and he stormed off into the night.  He stomped down the street blindly, only to open his eyes and see he was soaring above tree tops.  What is this monstrosity he thought.  He squinted his eyes to look closely and a bright beam of light blinded him.  He opened his eyes only to find the world has stopped.  No sound, no birds, no cars.  Had he stopped time by squinting?  He squinted once again only to find noise arousing all around him.  Super Jump, Time Freeze, what else could he possibly have? But he wondered, where did he get these powers?
